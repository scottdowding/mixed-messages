This script creates an object with 3 arrays that hold a noun, adjectiveOne, and adjectiveTwo. A loop goes through each property/value pair of the object and assigns a random index to store different elements of the 3 arrays to 3 different corresponding variables. Then a string is created with these three variables, and the string is then printed to the console.
